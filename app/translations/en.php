  'faq' => [
    'title'=>'Frequently asked questions',
    'q1'=>'How much power does my air conditioner need?',
    'a1'=>'The requirement depends on room size, orientation and insulation. As a guideline, around 100 BTU per square metre suits a standard space. High ceilings, large windows or strong sun exposure may require more capacity. We perform an on-site thermal study to size the system correctly and avoid needless consumption.',
    'q2'=>'How much does an inverter unit consume?',
    'a2'=>'Usage depends on the rated output and energy efficiency. A 3.5 kW split with an A++ label draws roughly 0.55 kWh per hour at medium load. Inverter technology adjusts compressor speed, reducing peaks and keeping the temperature stable with less electricity.',
    'q3'=>'How can I extend my AC’s lifespan?',
    'a3'=>'Key practices:',
    'a3.i1'=>'Clean or replace filters twice a year.',
    'a3.i2'=>'Keep the outdoor unit clear and ventilated.',
    'a3.i3'=>'Use auto mode and timers.',
    'a3.i4'=>'Set around 24 °C in summer and 21 °C in winter.',
    'a3.i5'=>'Close doors and windows while running.',
    'q4'=>'Which heating system is most efficient?',
    'a4'=>'For Alicante’s mild climate, an air-to-air heat pump offers excellent efficiency. In larger homes or buildings with existing radiators, a gas boiler or hybrid system may be more suitable. We evaluate insulation, usage and budget to propose the best-performing option.',
    'q5'=>'Do you install solar thermal systems?',
    'a5'=>'Yes. We design and install solar collectors for domestic hot water and to support heating circuits. The system harnesses Alicante’s sunshine to cut electricity or gas consumption and meets current regulations.',
    'q6'=>'Which brands do you work with?',
    'a6'=>'We install and service top manufacturers including Daikin, Mitsubishi Electric, Fujitsu, Panasonic, LG, Gree, Toshiba and Haier. Equipment is recommended based on efficiency and spare-part availability.',
    'q7'=>'What warranties do you provide?',
    'a7'=>'All installations are registered with the authorities and covered by a genuine 3-year warranty. We also offer technical support throughout the equipment’s life and advise on mandatory maintenance to keep the manufacturer’s guarantee.',
    'q8'=>'Which areas do you cover?',
    'a8'=>'We operate across the entire province of Alicante with short response times. Regular service in Benidorm, Altea, La Nucía, Calpe, Finestrat, Alfaz del Pi, Villajoyosa and nearby towns.',
